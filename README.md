# Custom Button Styling

![White Color Slide to unlock logo](./Demo/WhiteLogo.png)


This is a simple project to demonstrate a custom button with a sweeping
highlight color just like the "Slide to unlock" text from the original
iPhone.

The purpose of the project is as a starter for exploring animation effects
and custom styling using SwiftUI.
